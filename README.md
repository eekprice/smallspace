🧠  **Core Problem Area**

**Current social media is too broad, commercialized, and untrustworthy.** 

- Smaller, private, emotionally safe spaces
- Tools to **document life**, **maintain genuine relationships**, and **pass things on thoughtfully**
- **Freedom from dark patterns, ad targeting, and performative sharing**

## Product Concept

---

A **“Private Digital Space”** platform focused on:

- **Life journaling & memory sharing**
- **Trusted Circles** – family, chosen friends, phases of life
- **Emotional maturity** over virality
- **Posthumous planning** (like Google's inactive account manager but more thoughtful and human)
- A **“Readwise for Life”** – reminds you of shared moments, old notes, people you haven’t talked to

## **Philosophies**

---

- **Do no harm** → avoid ad-driven revenue, sticky UX, and virality traps
- **Private by default** → granular control, temporary mutes, opt-in sharing
- **Human-scale** → tailored to Dunbar’s number (close relationships you can *actually* manage)
- **Trust & transparency** → oversight board, community rules, intentional use
- **Never “grow at all costs”** → sustainable, human business model
